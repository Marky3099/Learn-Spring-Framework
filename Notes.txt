Tightly Coupled - two or more components are dependent to each other
Loosely Coupled - components can function independently
Bean - Any Object that are created in Java.
Spring Bean - Any Object that are created in Spring Framework
Spring Container - Handle the beans and wire them.
@Primary - A bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified
@Qualifier - A specific bean should be auto-wired(name of the bean can be used as qualifier)
@Autowired - used for automatic dependency injection
	- Just @Autowired - Only the (preffered) bean
	- @Autowired + @Qualifier - Use specific bean
@Qualifier has higher priorty than @Primary
@Component - allows Spring to detect custom beans
@ComponentScan - detect custom beans on a certain package 
	ex: @ComponentScan("custom-package") 
		if no params @ComponentScan will detect the current package

Dependency Injection Types
Constructor-based - Dependencies are set by creating the Bean using its Constructor
Setter-based - Dependencies are set by calling setter methods on your beans
Field - No setter or constructor. Dependency is injected using reflection.
